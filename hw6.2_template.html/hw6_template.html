<h3>This map uses the Equal Interval classification scheme. The main pro for this classification scheme is that it is easy to grasp, as each class is the same size. This classification scheme works best for data that is spread throughout the entire ration from 0 to 1. If there are gaps in the data, entire classes might go without any data in them and entire colors on the scale may go unused. </h3>

<h3>This map uses the Natural Breaks classification scheme. This classification scheme works well for many data sets because it finds "natural breaks" in the data, or it divides them into chunks based on how similar the values are to one another. This creates a more understandable map visually, as it groups all similar data values together in one class. This data set would not work well with more spread out data, though, because data spread evenly from 0 to 1 may not have any natural breaking points.</h3>

<h3>This map uses the Quantile classification scheme. This classification scheme works best for data sets that are spread out evenly among the classes. If the data is not evenly spread, values that are quite different might end up in the same class, or the same value could potentially end up in two different classes.</h3>
