<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>

<h3>The average American's work commute is 27.6 minutes. However, this number can vary a lot depending on where you live, what you do for a living, and where jobs like yours are most common. Below is a map that displays, by county, how many people fall within the "average" work commute time. As expected, their are higher reports of average commute time in more urban counties surrounding Charlotte and the Triangle area, and commute times differ more (perhaps are even longer) in more rural counties.</h3>
