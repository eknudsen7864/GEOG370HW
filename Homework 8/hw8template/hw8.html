<h1>Homework 8: Vector Spatial Analysis </h1>
<h2>Eren Knudsen</h2>
<h3>Below is a map of a portion of the Neuse River Basin along the coast of North Carolina and where this basin's streams and rivers may be contaminated with hog waste. I started by plotting all the rivers and all the hog farms in North Carolina as vector layers, and I zoomed in on just the coastal region near an estuary that I'm studying in another class. I looked up the average groundwater flow rate and used that to create a buffer around each hog farm to represent how far contaminated groundwater might spread. Then, I used the "intersect" geoprocessing tool to find where these regions of contaminated groundwater intersected with rivers. Knowing where contaminated water is entering a river system can be beneficial when trying to pinpoint sources of nutrient loading that lead to things like eutrophication and fish kill events; knowing where the source is can give information about how much of a contaminant is present, as well as how far and fast it is spreading through the system. Knowing areas of contamination can alos be beneficial when developing policies that regulate the hog industry and the environment.</h3>
